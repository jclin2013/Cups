# Cups
* [Live link](https://angularcups.herokuapp.com/)

Built in less than a day, Cups is a full-stack, single-page web app demonstrating how to implement basic CRUD functionality using Angular.js on the frontend and Node.js on the backend. A user can create, edit and delete cups in the cup collection, and have those changes persist in a PostgreSQL database. Altering the cup 'display' size changes how large the cup appears in the 'dashboard' view.
